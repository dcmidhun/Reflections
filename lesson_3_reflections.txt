When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local ?
---> Remote repositories are used to push and pull the info to GitHib.  Updating every commit that made in local directory to GitHub            leads to an unfinished work ending up public. Remote repository helps to push or pull the commits manually when we intend to do so.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
---> Setting up an auto update keeps the GitHub up-to-date but the updates might not be  meaningfull as some unfinished work might be
     published on GitHub.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
---> 'frok' is used to clone repositories form GitHub to GitHub, 'clone' is used to clone a repository from github to local directory and
     'branch' is used to create a separate workflow of commits different from the master branch.
