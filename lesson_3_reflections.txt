When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local ?
---> Remote repositories are used to push and pull the info to GitHib.  Updating every commit that made in local leads to an unfinished
     work ending up public. Only info pushed into remote repository ends up on GitHub and any other commits not pushed can be accessed 
     form local directory.
