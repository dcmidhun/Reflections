1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
---> A empty git repository is initialized in the directory and all the changes made can be committed and tracked.

2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
---> Staging area is just a space to add all the files that needs to be committed. Working directory contains all the master files 
    and a repository contains all the commits ever made in the working directory.
