1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
---> A empty git repository is initialized in the directory and all the changes made can be committed and tracked.

2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
---> Staging area is just a space to add all the files that needs to be committed. Working directory contains all the master files 
    and a repository contains all the commits ever made in the working directory.

3. How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
---> Staging area helps to check the changes made to the file by comparing it with the most recent commit in the repository.

4. What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
---> Braches are useful when a different version of the file or result is required without any changes to the current or 
    original version. Can also be used to experiment with the code without loosing the original version.

5. How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
---> It clearly helps  to understand the path of the branch and brach commits.
